        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Joshua Dodo, a passionate frontend developer with a deep
          love for creating meaningful digital experiences. My journey into tech
          began with curiosity and has evolved into a mission to build solutions
          that make a real difference in people's lives.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 16px">
          I specialize in modern web technologies and have a particular interest
          in creating accessible, performant, and user-friendly applications.
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the basketball court,
          strategizing over a chess board, or diving into a good book. I believe
          in continuous learning and the power of technology to transform
          communities.

        <h2>Areas Where I Seek Growth</h2>
        <p>
          Self-awareness is key to growth, and I believe in being honest about
          areas where I can improve:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Advanced CSS Animations and Transitions:</strong> While I
            can create basic animations, I want to master complex,
            performance-optimized animations using CSS transforms, keyframes,
            and modern techniques like view transitions API.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Web Performance Optimization:</strong> I'm still building my
            expertise in optimizing Core Web Vitals, implementing lazy loading
            strategies, code splitting, and understanding the critical rendering
            path for blazing-fast user experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advanced State Management Patterns:</strong> While I'm
            comfortable with basic React state, I want to deepen my
            understanding of complex state management solutions, context
            optimization, and handling large-scale application state
            efficiently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frontend Testing & Accessibility:</strong> I recognize the
            importance of comprehensive testing but want to improve my approach
            to writing effective unit tests, integration tests, and ensuring
            WCAG compliance across all components.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>My Approach to Learning</h3>
          <p>
            I embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. Every project
            where I feel uncertain is a chance to expand my skills and push
            beyond my comfort zone.

        <h2>A Note to My Future Self</h2>
        <p>Dear Future Joshua,</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 16px">
          As you read this, I hope you've remained curious and humble. Remember
          that the journey is just as important as the destination. The late
          nights debugging, the moments of breakthrough, and the lessons learned
          from failures have all shaped who you've become.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 16px">
          Stay true to your values: prioritize people over technology, seek to
          understand before being understood, and never stop learning. The field
          of technology evolves rapidly, but the principles of good
          engineering clarity, simplicity, and empathy remain timeless.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 16px">
          Keep building things that matter. Keep pushing yourself to grow. Keep
          lifting others as you climb. And most importantly, remember to enjoy
          the process and celebrate your progress, no matter how small.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 16px">You've got this!</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-style: italic; color: #8b8ca8">
          — Your past self, committed to growth and excellence

      <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
        <h2>Additional Thoughts & Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>On Learning:</strong> I believe that the best way to learn is
          by doing. Every project, every bug, every code review is an
          opportunity to deepen understanding. I'm a strong advocate for
          learning in public by sharing knowledge, asking questions, and
          contributing to the community.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 16px">
          <strong>On Collaboration:</strong> Great software is rarely built in
          isolation. I value diverse perspectives and believe that the best
          solutions emerge when people with different backgrounds and
          experiences come together to solve problems.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 16px">
          <strong>On Balance:</strong> While I'm passionate about coding, I also
          recognize the importance of balance. Whether it's playing basketball
          to clear my mind, enjoying a game of chess to sharpen strategic
          thinking, or simply spending time with loved ones, these experiences
          make me a better developer and a better person.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
          <p>
            At the core of everything I do is a simple belief: technology should
            empower people and improve lives. Every line of code I write is
            guided by this principle, and every project I undertake is an
            opportunity to make a positive impact.
